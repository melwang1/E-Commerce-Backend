User Story
As a manager at an internet retail company they want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies

Acceptance Criteria
Given a functional Express.js API database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file to connect to a database using Sequelize
I am able to use the command line to invoke the application to run and to be in sync with MySql database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
